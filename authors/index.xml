      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an epidemiologist with research interests in developing and
applying causal inference methods to better understand how to prevent
and treat substance use disorders and prevent violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current work focuses on understanding issues related to data support
and complex exposures and developing and applying methods for
transportability and mediation to understand mechanisms relevant for
drug use disorder prevention and treatment in various target
populations. More generally, my work on generalizing/ transporting
findings from study samples to target populations and identifying
subpopulations most likely to benefit from interventions contributes to
efforts to optimally target available policy and program resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed a PhD in Epidemiology and an MHS in Biostatistics from the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was a Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
