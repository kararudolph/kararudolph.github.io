      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kara Rudolph is an epidemiologist with research interests in developing and
applying causal inference methods to understand social and contextual
influences on mental health, substance use, and violence in disadvantaged,
urban areas of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her current work focuses on developing methods for transportability and
mediation, and subsequently applying those methods to understand how aspects
of the school and peer environments mediate relationships between neighborhood
factors and adolescent drug use across populations. More generally, her work
on generalizing/ transporting findings from study samples to target
populations and identifying subpopulations most likely to benefit from
interventions contributes to efforts to optimally target available policy and
program resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She completed a PhD in Epidemiology and an MHS in Biostatistics from the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was a Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Health and Society Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
