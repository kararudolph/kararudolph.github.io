      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an epidemiologist with research interests in developing and applying
causal inference methods to understand social and contextual influences on
mental health, substance use, and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current work focuses on developing and applying methods for
transportability and mediations to understand mechanisms relevant for drug use
disorder prevention and treatment in various target populations. More
generally, my work on generalizing/ transporting findings from study samples
to target populations and identifying subpopulations most likely to benefit
from interventions contributes to efforts to optimally target available policy
and program resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed a PhD in Epidemiology and an MHS in Biostatistics from the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was a Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Health and Society Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
